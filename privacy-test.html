            regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation,

        <p>Um unser Onlineangebot sicher und effizient bereitstellen zu können, nehmen wir die Leistungen von einem oder
            mehreren Webhosting-Anbietern in Anspruch, von deren Servern (bzw. von ihnen verwalteten Servern) das
            Onlineangebot abgerufen werden kann. Zu diesen Zwecken können wir Infrastruktur- und
            Plattformdienstleistungen,
            Rechenkapazität, Speicherplatz und Datenbankdienste sowie Sicherheitsleistungen und technische
            Wartungsleistungen in Anspruch nehmen.</p>
        <p>Zu den im Rahmen der Bereitstellung des Hostingangebotes verarbeiteten Daten können alle die Nutzer unseres
            Onlineangebotes betreffenden Angaben gehören, die im Rahmen der Nutzung und der Kommunikation anfallen.
            Hierzu
            gehören regelmäßig die IP-Adresse, die notwendig ist, um die Inhalte von Onlineangeboten an Browser
            ausliefern
            zu können, und alle innerhalb unseres Onlineangebotes oder von Webseiten getätigten Eingaben.</p>
        <p><strong>Erhebung von Zugriffsdaten und Logfiles</strong>: Wir selbst (bzw. unser Webhostinganbieter) erheben
            Daten zu jedem Zugriff auf den Server (sogenannte Serverlogfiles). Zu den Serverlogfiles können die Adresse
            und
            Name der abgerufenen Webseiten und Dateien, Datum und Uhrzeit des Abrufs, übertragene Datenmengen, Meldung
            über
            erfolgreichen Abruf, Browsertyp nebst Version, das Betriebssystem des Nutzers, Referrer URL (die zuvor
            besuchte
            Seite) und im Regelfall IP-Adressen und der anfragende Provider gehören.</p>
        <p>Die Serverlogfiles können zum einen zu Zwecken der Sicherheit eingesetzt werden, z.B., um eine Überlastung
            der
            Server zu vermeiden (insbesondere im Fall von missbräuchlichen Angriffen, sogenannten DDoS-Attacken) und zum
            anderen, um die Auslastung der Server und ihre Stabilität sicherzustellen.</p>

        <p>Wir unterhalten Onlinepräsenzen innerhalb sozialer Netzwerke und verarbeiten in diesem Rahmen Daten der
            Nutzer,
            um mit den dort aktiven Nutzern zu kommunizieren oder um Informationen über uns anzubieten.</p>
        <p>Wir weisen darauf hin, dass dabei Daten der Nutzer außerhalb des Raumes der Europäischen Union verarbeitet
            werden
            können. Hierdurch können sich für die Nutzer Risiken ergeben, weil so z.B. die Durchsetzung der Rechte der
            Nutzer erschwert werden könnte. Im Hinblick auf US-Anbieter, die unter dem Privacy-Shield zertifiziert sind
            oder
            vergleichbare Garantien eines sicheren Datenschutzniveaus bieten, weisen wir darauf hin, dass sie sich damit
            verpflichten, die Datenschutzstandards der EU einzuhalten.</p>
        <p>Ferner werden die Daten der Nutzer innerhalb sozialer Netzwerke im Regelfall für Marktforschungs- und
            Werbezwecke
            verarbeitet. So können z.B. anhand des Nutzungsverhaltens und sich daraus ergebender Interessen der Nutzer
            Nutzungsprofile erstellt werden. Die Nutzungsprofile können wiederum verwendet werden, um z.B. Werbeanzeigen
            innerhalb und außerhalb der Netzwerke zu schalten, die mutmaßlich den Interessen der Nutzer entsprechen. Zu
            diesen Zwecken werden im Regelfall Cookies auf den Rechnern der Nutzer gespeichert, in denen das
            Nutzungsverhalten und die Interessen der Nutzer gespeichert werden. Ferner können in den Nutzungsprofilen
            auch
            Daten unabhängig der von den Nutzern verwendeten Geräte gespeichert werden (insbesondere, wenn die Nutzer
            Mitglieder der jeweiligen Plattformen sind und bei diesen eingeloggt sind).</p>

        <p>Auch im Fall von Auskunftsanfragen und der Geltendmachung von Betroffenenrechten weisen wir darauf hin, dass
            diese am effektivsten bei den Anbietern geltend gemacht werden können. Nur die Anbieter haben jeweils
            Zugriff
            auf die Daten der Nutzer und können direkt entsprechende Maßnahmen ergreifen und Auskünfte geben. Sollten
            Sie
            dennoch Hilfe benötigen, dann können Sie sich an uns wenden.</p>

                oder
                Dienstleistungen in Anspruch nehmen). Hierzu ist es erforderlich, dass die Anbieter nachverfolgen
                können, ob
                Nutzer, die sich für bestimmte Angebote interessieren, diese anschließend auf die Veranlassung der
                Affiliate-Links wahrnehmen. Daher ist es für die Funktionsfähigkeit von Affiliate-Links erforderlich,
                dass
                sie um bestimmte Werte ergänzt werden, die ein Bestandteil des Links werden oder anderweitig, z.B. in
                einem
                Cookie, gespeichert werden. Zu den Werten gehören insbesondere die Ausgangswebseite (Referrer), der
                Zeitpunkt, eine Online-Kennung der Betreiber der Webseite, auf der sich der Affiliate-Link befand, eine
                Online-Kennung des jeweiligen Angebotes, eine Online-Kennung des Nutzers als auch
                nachverfolgungsspezifische
                Werte, wie, z.B. Werbemittel-ID, Partner-ID und Kategorisierungen. </li>
            <li><strong>Personenbezogene Daten:</strong> "Personenbezogene Daten“ sind alle Informationen, die sich auf
                eine
                identifizierte oder identifizierbare natürliche Person (im Folgenden "betroffene Person“) beziehen; als
                identifizierbar wird eine natürliche Person angesehen, die direkt oder indirekt, insbesondere mittels
                Zuordnung zu einer Kennung wie einem Namen, zu einer Kennnummer, zu Standortdaten, zu einer
                Online-Kennung
                (z.B. Cookie) oder zu einem oder mehreren besonderen Merkmalen identifiziert werden kann, die Ausdruck
                der
                physischen, physiologischen, genetischen, psychischen, wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen oder sozialen
                Identität
                dieser natürlichen Person sind. </li>
            <li><strong>Remarketing:</strong> Vom "Remarketing“ bzw. "Retargeting“ spricht man, wenn z.B. zu
                Werbezwecken
                vermerkt wird, für welche Produkte sich ein Nutzer auf einer Webseite interessiert hat, um den Nutzer
                auf
                anderen Webseiten an diese Produkte, z.B. in Werbeanzeigen, zu erinnern. </li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Vom "Tracking“ spricht man, wenn das Verhalten von Nutzern über mehrere
                Onlineangebote hinweg nachvollzogen werden kann. Im Regelfall werden im Hinblick auf die genutzten
                Onlineangebote Verhaltens- und Interessensinformationen in Cookies oder auf Servern der Anbieter der
                Trackingtechnologien gespeichert (sogenanntes Profiling). Diese Informationen können anschließend z.B.
                eingesetzt werden, um den Nutzern Werbeanzeigen anzuzeigen, die voraussichtlich deren Interessen
                entsprechen. </li>
            <li><strong>Verantwortlicher:</strong> Als "Verantwortlicher“ wird die natürliche oder juristische Person,
                Behörde, Einrichtung oder andere Stelle, die allein oder gemeinsam mit anderen über die Zwecke und
                Mittel
                der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten entscheidet, bezeichnet. </li>
            <li><strong>Verarbeitung:</strong> "Verarbeitung" ist jeder mit oder ohne Hilfe automatisierter Verfahren
                ausgeführte Vorgang oder jede solche Vorgangsreihe im Zusammenhang mit personenbezogenen Daten. Der
                Begriff
                reicht weit und umfasst praktisch jeden Umgang mit Daten, sei es das Erheben, das Auswerten, das
                Speichern,
                das Übermitteln oder das Löschen. </li>
